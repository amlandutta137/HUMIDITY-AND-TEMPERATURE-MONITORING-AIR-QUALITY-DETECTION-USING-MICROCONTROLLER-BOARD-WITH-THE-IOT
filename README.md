# HUMIDITY-AND-TEMPERATURE-MONITORING-AIR-QUALITY-DETECTION-USING-MICROCONTROLLER-BOARD-WITH-THE-IOT
The "Humidity, Temperature Monitoring and Air Quality  Detection using Microcontroller Board with IoT" project presents a  comprehensive solution for real-time environmental monitoring. By leveraging  the power of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the system enables continuous  tracking of temperature, humidity, and air quality.

With a focus on real-time monitoring, this project titled Humidity, 
Temperature Monitoring and Air Quality Detection using Microcontroller 
Board with IoT" project for indoor environments represents a cutting-edge 
solution in the realm of environmental sensing and Internet of Things (IoT) 
technology. This initiative addresses the critical need for monitoring 
indoor air quality, humidity, and temperature in real-time, offering users 
actionable insights to create healthier and more comfortable living or 
working spaces. By integrating advanced sensors, a microcontroller board, 
and IoT connectivity, this project not only ensures precise environmental 
data collection but also facilitates remote monitoring and control for 
enhanced convenience and well-being. The integration of Internet of 
Things (IoT) technology with a microcontroller board allows for real-time 
data acquisition, analysis, and remote monitoring. 
The primary objective of this project is to design a system that monitors 
and provides real-time data on humidity, temperature, and air quality. By 
utilizing a microcontroller board with IoT capabilities, the project aims to 
create a smart and connected solution for environmental monitoring.
